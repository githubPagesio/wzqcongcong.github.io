Substrate for macOS

**macSubstrate** is a platform tool for interprocess code injection on macOS, with the similar function to [Cydia Substrate](http://www.cydiasubstrate.com/) on iOS. Using macSubstrate, you can inject your plugins (`.bundle` or `.framework`) into a mac app (including sandboxed apps) to tweak it in the runtime.

* All you need is to get or create plugins for your target app.
* No trouble with modification and codesign for the original target app.
* No more work after the target app is updated.
* Super easy to install or uninstall a plugin.
* Loading plugins automatically whenever the target app is relaunched.
* Providing a GUI app to make injection much easier.
